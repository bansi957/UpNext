UpNext | Mentors | MyQueries | Add Request | Profile

✅ Suggested (Final)

UpNext | Mentors | Ask Question | My Queries | Messages | Resources | Profile

Why these additions?

Ask Question → clearer than “Add Request” (student-friendly wording)

Messages → direct access to chat (very important UX)

Resources (optional) → career links, roadmaps, PDFs, senior tips

💡 If navbar feels crowded → move Resources inside a dropdown.
